		<h3><font color = "#FEFEFE">Percents Lesson</font></h3>
		<hr>
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.1 Introduction</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Percent problems are amongst the easiest problems on the SAT, 
		yet they are also amongst the most frequently missed problems. The reason for this is that most 
		people were not correctly taught to use percents at an early age. However, the proper way to 
		do percent problems can easily be learned. This is good news because percent problems are very plentiful.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">We cannot do percent problems with percents. Thus the first step in any percent problem 
		is to turn the percent into a decimal. This is done by moving the decimal point twice to the left.</font></p>		
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">87% = 0.87<br>3.5% = 0.025</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The second step is to turn this decimal into a multiplier. How the decimal is turned 
		into a multiplier depends on the type of problem.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.2 Increasing Problems</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Many percent problems involve a quantity that is increasing. Situations that involve 
		an increasing quantity are frequently in the form of a sales tax, a raise, a tip, growth, interest, or other increasing quantity.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">In these types of problems, the multiplier (m) is formed as follows</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = 1 + p</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where p is the percent turned into decimal form. This multiplier m is then multiplied 
		by the quantity to find the new quantity.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">For example, if someone earns $12.00 per hour and receives a 5% raise, we find the 
		multiplier as follows</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">and multiply it by the old wage in order to find the new wage:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">$12.00 x 1.05 = $12.60</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.3 Decreasing Problems</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Another common category of percent problems involve a quantity that is 
		decreasing. Situations that involve a decreasing quantity are frequently in the form of a sale, discount, decay, or other 
		decreasing quantity.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">In these types of problems, the multiplier (m) is formed as follows</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = 1 - p</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where p is the percent turned into decimal form. This multiplier m is 
		then multiplied by the quantity to find the new quantity.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">For example, if a $40.00 pair of jeans are 15% off, we find the multiplier as follows</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">and multiply it by the original price of the jeans in order to find the new price of the jeans:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">$40.00 x 0.85 = $34.00</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.4 "Percent Of" Problems</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The easiest type of percent problems are "percent of" problems. In these problems we are looking for 
		some part or portion of the original quantity. In these types of problems, the multiplier (m) is simply</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = p</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where p is the percent turned into decimal form. The multiplier m is then multiplied by the original 
		quantity to find the new quantity.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">For example, if a high school has 1,560 students and 70% of the students are planning on attending 
		the dance, we simply do</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">1,560 x 0.70 = 1,092</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">to find that 1,092 students will attend the dance.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.5 Percent Word Problems</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Many percent problems occur in the form of word problems. The trick to these problems is to determine 
		whether it is a percent increasing or percent decreasing problem, give any unknown value a variable, and to carefully walk through the scenario in chronological 
		order.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you pay $43.20 for a pair of jeans after an 8% sales tax, what was the sticker price of the jeans?</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This is a percent increasing problem and the unknown value is the original price, which we will call p. 
		Walking through the problem chronologically, the first thing that happened was that the you picked up the pair of jeans, which had price p. Then an 8% sales 
		tax was applied, so our multiplier will be 1.08. The result is that the final price became $43.20. Thus we have the equation that can easily be solved for 
		p.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">p x 1.08 = 43.20</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">2.6 Turning other things into percents</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To determine by what percent something has increased or decreased, simply set up an equation chronologically 
		and use the logic of increasing multipliers and decreasing multipliers from above.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If the population of a city has increased from 60,000 to 63,000, what percent has it increased by?</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">60000 x m = 63000<br>m = 1.05</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Thus the population has increased 5%.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If a stock was priced at $200 per share but is now priced at $170 per share, what percent has it decreased 
		by?</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">200 x m = 170<br>m = 0.85</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Thus the stock has lost 15% of its value.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">Warm Up Question Explanation</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The answer to the warm up question is "B. $455". The sale price of the table was $299. This is equal to 
		the cost from the wholesaler plus 15%. Thus, $299 = 1.15(cost from the wholesaler), and the cost from the wholesaler is $299 / 1.15 = $260. The usual price 
		is the cost of the wholesaler, $260, plus 75%. Therefore, the usual price the store charges for the table is 1.75($260) = $455, which is B.</font></p>
