		<p><font color = "#FEFEFE">Many students have not had any exposure to statistics and feel overwhelmed by the statistics questions on the SAT. While there are 
		statistical concepts on the SAT, they are all cursory and easy to master.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.1 Counting Problems</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If asked to determine how many possibilities there are in a scenario, simply draw a line for each decision 
		that must be made. Then write the number of options there are for each slot/decision. Finally, multiply all of these together.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If someone must choose an outfit from 4 pairs of shoes, 5 pairs of pants, and 8 shirts, how many possibilities 
		are there?</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.2 Distributions</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A distribution is simply a visual representation of how data is spread out, such as with a histogram 
		(bar chart).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Normal distribution</strong> A normal distribution is one that looks like this. It is symmetrical 
		across its center. The ends that trail off on either side are known as "tails."</font></p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Skew</strong> Skew occurs when one of the tails of a distribution is pulled out or elongated. 
		If the right tail is pulled out or elongated, it is "right skew." If the left tail is pulled out or elongated, it is "left skew." Skew is about an overall 
		trend in the data, not individual data points.</font></p>

		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Outliers</strong> Outliers are similar to skew in that they represent the data stretching out 
		in one direction. But it is about individual data points lying outside the general trend of the data. In the following graph, 9 is an outlier.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.3 Measures of Center</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Measures of center are various ways to determining what the center or middle of a group of data is.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Mean</strong> The mean of data is just the average of all the data points. That is, it can be calculated 
		by adding all the data points together and dividing by the number of data points. The key thing to remember about the mean is that it is not resistant to outliers or 
		skew. That is, the mean will move towards any outliers or towards the skewed tail of a distribution. Therefore if there is skew or if there are outliers, the mean is 
		a bad measure of center to use.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Median</strong> The median is the middle data point when the data points have been arranged from least 
		to greatest. Students frequently forget to arrange the data points from least to greatest first. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average 
		of the middle two data points. The key thing to know about the median is that it is resistant to outliers and skew. Therefore, if there is skew or if there are 
		outliers, it is a better measure of center than the mean.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Mode</strong> The mode is simply the most frequently occurring data point. If there are multiple data 
		points that are repeated the same number of times, then each of them is the mode. The mode is not a particularly useful measure of center and should only be used 
		if you are specifically asked for it.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Expected Value</strong> Expected value is computed by multiplying the value of each outcome by its 
		probability and then adding all of these numbers.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_5.PNG" alt="Statistics and Probability Diagram 5">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Here the expected value would be $0(0.3) + $1(.4) + $5(.2) + $10(.1) = $0.00 + $0.40 + $1.00 + $1.00 = 
		$2.40</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Getting the Mean and Median from a Table or Graph</strong> If you are presented with a table 
		or chart with data, finding the mean and the median is easy if you know what you're looking for.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> To find the median, you just need to find the middle item in the already organized data.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> To find the mean, you need to determine what would be in the numerator (top) and denominator 
		(bottom) of your fraction and then use the table to get this data.</font></p>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are 35 students, therefore the 18th student will be the middle student. There are 12 students with 
		0 pets and then there are 10 students with 1 pet, which means we have passed over 22 students. Therefore, the 18th student will be in the group with 1 pet 
		and the median number of pets will be 1.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To determine the mean, we need to figure out what we're looking for. If we're looking for the mean number 
		of pets per student, the fraction will look like this</font></p>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">We know that there are 35 students. To determine the total number of pets, we simply multiply each number 
		of pets by the number of students in that category.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.4 Measures of Spread</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Measures of spread are various ways of determining how spread out or how clumped together data is.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Range</strong> Range is simply the largest data point (the max) minus the smallest data point (the min). 
		Thus it is easy to calculate. However, it is not particularly useful since it only compares two of the data points.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Inter Quartile Range (IQR)</strong> The inter quartile range (IQR) is subtracting the first quartile 
		(Q<sub>1</sub>) from the third quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>)</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The first quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>) is the median of the minimum and the median. That is, it is the middle 
		value between the minimum and the median.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The third quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>) is the median of the median and the maximum. That is, it is the middle 
		value between the median and the maximum.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Standard Deviation or Variance</strong> Standard deviation and variance are more technical measures 
		of the spread of data. You will not have to calculate standard deviation or variance on the SAT. However, you can think of the standard deviation and variance as 
		being the average distance of the data points from the center of the data. Thus a large standard deviation or variance means the data is more spread out; a small 
		standard deviation or variance means the data is more closely clumped around the center of the data.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.5 Regression and Scatterplots</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Scatterplots are plots of data that have two variables, such as <i>hours spent studying for the SAT</i> and 
		<i>score on the SAT</i>.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_9.PNG" alt="Statistics and Probability Diagram 9">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Each point in the scatterplot is an actual data point that represents an observation.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The line passing through the scatterplot is known as the line of best fit. It describes the data and can be 
		used to predict what one variable will be if the other variable is known.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The residual is the distance between an actual data point and what the line of best fit predicts for the y 
		variable.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are several terms that can be used to describe a scatterplot.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> Data is linear if it generally fits into a straight line. Data is nonlinear if it is generally 
		curved.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> A scatterplot has strong association or correlation if it falls close to the line of best fit. 
		It has weak association or correlation if it is more spread out from the line of best fit.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> A scatterplot has a positive association if the slop of the line of best fit is positive. It has a negative 
		association if the slope of the line of best fit is negative.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.6 Basic Statistical Concepts</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are a few statistical concepts that you need to have a basic understanding of.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Sampling Bias</strong> Sampling bias occurs when the people you choose to question are not 
		<i>truly</i> random. That is, if the people you choose to question are not truly random, then there is bias.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">For example, if you want to gather statistics about a city and stand on a street corner and ask questions 
		of everyone who walks by, this may appear random at first. But it is not actually random because only certain segments of the city population may pass by 
		that street corner.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Survey Bias</strong> Survey bias occurs when the way that you ask questions in your survey 
		influences how people respond to the questions.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Inference</strong> Inference is the concept that the statistics you gather cannot apply 
		beyond the group that you drew your sample from. For example, if you do a random survey of people at your school, you cannot use that data to draw 
		inferences about everyone in your city because the two populations (people at your school and people in your city) are different.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.7 Probability</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Probability of an event A is defined as follows:</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">11.8 Table Data</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">When data is presented in a table and the question asks the probability of choosing a certain 
		item from the table, careful attention must be given to the numerator (top) and the denominator (bottom) of the fraction.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_15.PNG" alt="Statistics and Probability Diagram 15">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">These questions must be read carefully because subtle wording can change the meaning of the 
		question significantly. The trick is to focus carefully on what the denominator (bottom) and numerator (top) will be.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">What is the probability that someone chosen at random has a pet? 36/70</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">What is the probability that someone chosen at random is a girl with no pet? 18/30</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">What is the probability that a boy chosen has a pet? 24/40</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Given that someone chosen has a pet, what is the probability that they are a girl? 12/36</font></p>
