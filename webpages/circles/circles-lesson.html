		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">10.1 Basic Formulas</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">On the ACT, you need to know the formulas for the circumferences (perimeter) of a circle and for the area of a 
		circle. These formulas are given to you on the SAT.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you are given a point on a circle, the best way to approach the problem is to draw a line from the point 
		to the x axis to create a triangle.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">You will also need to know the general graphing form of a circle:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + (y - k)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r (not r<sup>2</sup>) is the radius of the circle. Thus the 
		following circle would have its center at (−5, 1) and would have a radius of 9.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">(x + 5)<sup>2</sup> + (y - 1)<sup>2</sup> = 81</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you are given an equation with both an x<sup>2</sup> term and a y<sup>2</sup> term, this is a circle. To put 
		it in graphing form, you need to complete the square twice: once for x and once for y. Completing the square twice below would result in the same equation of the 
		circle above in graphing form.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">10.2 Arc Length</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Arc length is simply a portion of the circumference (perimeter) of a circle. It is determined by setting up a 
		ratio between the arc length and the total circumference (perimeter) on the one hand, and the central angle and the total number of degrees (360°) on the other 
		hand.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Sector area is simply a portion of the area of a circle. To determine the sector area, we simply set up a 
		ratio between the sector area and the total area of the circle on the one hand, and the central angle and the total number of degrees (360°) on the other 
		hand.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">10.4 Central Angles and Inscribed Angles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A central angle is an angle with its vertex at the center of a circle. An inscribed angle is an angle with its 
		vertex on the edge of the circle. If a central angle and an inscribed angle point to the same arc, then the central angle will be twice the inscribed 
		angle.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Here, angle BOA is a central angle and angle BCA is an inscribed angle. Therefore, angle BOA is twice 
		angle BCA.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">10.5 Central Angle Measure</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you are asked to find the central angle measure, you simply need to use the ratios described above 
		for arc length or sector area (depending on what you are given) and then solve for the central angle measure.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">10.6 Tangent Lines</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A line that is tangent to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point. In addition, 
		The tangent line will be perpendicular to the radius from the center of the circle to the point of tangency. Therefore, the angle should immediately be 
		marked as being 90°.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">Warm Up Question Explanation</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Since segment BC is tangent to the circle at B, it follows that BC ⊥ OB, and so triangle OBC is a 
		right triangle with its right angle at B. Since OB = 6 and OB and OA are both radii of the circle, OA = OB = 6, and OC = OA + AC = 12. Thus, triangle OBC is a 
		right triangle with the length of the hypotenuse (OC = 12) twice the length of one of its legs (OB = 6). It follows that triangle OBC is a 30°-60°-90° triangle 
		with its 30° angle at C and its 60° angle at O. The area of the shaded region is the area of triangle OBC minus the area of the sector bounded by radii 
		OA and OB.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">In the 30°-60°-90° triangle OBC, the length of side OB, which is opposite the 30° angle, is 6. Thus, the 
		length of side BC, which is opposite the 60° angle, is 6√3 . Hence, the area of triangle OBC is (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>)(6)(6√3 ​) = 18√3. Since the 
		sector bounded by radii OA and OB has central angle 60°, the area of this sector is <sup>60</sup>&frasl;<sub>360</sub> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> of the 
		area of the circle. Since the circle has radius 6, its area is <br>π(6)<sup>2</sup> = 36π, and so the area of the sector is (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>)(36π ) = 6π. 
		Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 18√3 − 6π, which is choice B.</font></p>
