		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">4.1 Definition and Overview</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A system of equations is simply a group of equations. To solve a system of equations, 
		you need to have the same number of equations as variables. Generally on the SAT, there will be two variables (usually x and y), 
		so you will need two equations to be able to solve the system.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">4.2 Methods Solving Systems of Equations</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are two methods for solving a system of equations with two equations and two unknowns. 
		Either will work for any given problem. However, problems will be set up to be done more quickly and easily in one form or the other. Therefore 
		students should be comfortable solving systems of equations using both methods and should solve using whichever method the system is set up for.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 10px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>4.2.1 Substitution</strong></font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Substitution is used when one variable is alone (or nearly alone) on one side of the equal sign. 
		This variable is then substituted (or "plugged in" to) the second equation.</font></p>	
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">x = 2y - 7<br>-2x - 5y = -4<br>-2(2y - 7) - 5y = -4<br>-4y + 14 - 5y = -4<br>-9y = -18<br>y = 2</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Substituting y = 2 into the first equation</font></p>	
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">x = 2(2) - 7<br>x = -3</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Thus the solution is x = −3, y = 2.</font></p>	
		<br>		
		<p style="margin-left: 10px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>4.2.2 Elimination</strong></font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The other method for solving systems of equations is elimination (also known as cancellation). 
		Elimination is used when there is a column of x terms, a column of y terms, a column of the equals signs, and a column of constant terms. One 
		(or both) of the lines is multiplied by a constant so that either the x column or the y column will cancel when the two equations are added 
		(or subtracted).</font></p>		
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">3x - 5y = 13<br>4x + 3y = -2</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Here the y column will cancel if we multiply the first line by 3 and multiply the second line by 5.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Systems of equations have three possible sets of solutions.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">4.4 Intersections</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you are asked where two lines intersect, this simply means that there is a system of equations. 
		You then simply use the tools for solving systems of equations. The x and y values of the solution (or solutions) are simply the point (or points) of 
		intersection of the graphs.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">4.5 Non-Linear Systems of Equations</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Occasionally there are questions with non-linear systems of equations. These are systems of equations 
		in which there are still two equations and two unknowns (generally x and y) but one or more of the variables has a power attached to them. These problems 
		are solved using the exact same methods for solving systems of equations: substitution or elimination. However, these questions are nearly always designed 
		to be solved using substitution.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">4.6 Turning Word Problems into Systems of Equations</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Turning word problems into systems of equations is one of the subjects students struggle with the most 
		on the SAT. However, some considerations can be very helpful.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">First, clearly define your variables. There will almost always be two variables in these types of questions 
		(occasionally there will only be one variable). Be sure to state exactly what the variable is mathematically. The variable will almost always be the quantity 
		of something. For example, if the problem is about apples and bananas, the variables will not be apples and bananas; they will be the number of apples and 
		the number of bananas.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Second, if you have two variables, you will need two equations. Generally define what your two equations 
		will be about. One will be about the quantity of items. The other will be about some other consideration, such as price, dollars, weight, time, etc.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Third, form the equation about the quantity of items. There are two types of quantity equations.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If you are told the total quantity of items, simply add the two variables and set them equal to this total 
		quantity. For example, if the total number of apples (a) and bananas (b) is 47</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">a + b = 47</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the two quantities are compared, you must think much more carefully about this equation. Students 
		regularly form these equations incorrectly because the English sentence will look somewhat different than the mathematical statement. For example, 
		if there are twice as many apples as bananas</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">a = 2b</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Student's natural inclination is to put the 2 with the a because that is where the 2 is in the sentence. 
		However, you must ask which quantity is larger (a) and what must be done to compensate for this to make the quantities equal (multiplying b by 2). Similarly, 
		if we are told there are 12 more apples than bananas</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">a = b + 12</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">because there are fewer bananas and we must add 12 to them to make them equal to the bananas.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Finally, form the equation that isn't about quantity. This is generally easier than the quantity 
		equation.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">Warm Up Question Explanation</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To answer the question, you first need to define the variables. The question discusses the prices of a pair of 
		pants and a briefcase and asks you to find the price of the pants. So it’s appropriate to let P be the price, in dollars, of the pants and to let B be the price, in 
		dollars, of the briefcase. Since the sum of the prices before sales tax was $130.00, the equation P + B = 130 is true. A sales tax of 9% was added to the price of 
		the briefcase. Since 9% is equal to 0.09, the price of the briefcase with tax was <br>B + 0.09B = 1.09B. There was no sales tax on the pants, and the total Maizah 
		paid, including tax, was $136.75, so the equation <br>P + 1.09B = 136.75 holds.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Now, you need to solve the system</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">P + B = 130<br>P + 1.09B = 136.75</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Subtracting the sides of the first equation from the corresponding sides of the second equation gives you <br>
		(P + 1.09B) − (P + B) = 136.75 − 130, which simplifies to 0.09B = 6.75. Now you can divide each side of 0.09B = 6.75 by 0.09. This gives you 
		B = <sup>6.75</sup>&frasl;<sub>0.09</sub> ​ = 75. This is the value of B, the price, in dollars, of the briefcase. The question asks for the price, in dollars, of 
		the pants, which is P. You can substitute 75 for B in the equation P + B = 130, which gives you P + 75 = 130, or <br>P = 130 − 75 = 55, so the pants cost $55. As such, 
		the correct answer choice is B.</font></p>
		<br>
