		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.1 Introduction</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are no pure geometry problems on the SAT. Instead, all geometry problems can and should be turned 
		into algebra problems easily and quickly. Only a few basic geometry concepts are needed to do this. If you find yourself delving into advanced geometry concepts 
		or doing a proof, you are not approaching the problem correctly. Instead, turn it into an algebra problem.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Generally this can be done by labeling the unknown quantity that you want to know with a variable 
		(a new variable if the problem already has other variables), using a geometry property to turn the problem into an algebra equation, and then solving for 
		the variable you want to know.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.2 Triangle Angles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">All the angles in a triangle add to be 180 degrees. This is a useful property for turn a problem into an 
		algebra equation.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The largest angle is always across from the longest side; the smallest angle is always across from the 
		shortest side.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.3 Complimentary and Supplementary Angles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If two angles are complimentary, they add to be 90 degrees. If two angles are supplementary, they add to 
		be 180 degrees. In either situation, an algebraic equation should be set up immediately.</font></p>
		<br>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Here, the angles are supplementary. Therefore angles should immediately be labeled and the algebraic 
		equation x + y = 180 can be used.</font></p>
		<br>

			<img src="Lesson_2.PNG" alt="Geometry Diagram 2">

		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Here, the angles are complimentary. Therefore, angles should immediately labeled and the algebraic 
		equation x + y = 90 can be used.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.4 Vertical Angles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">When two (or more) lines intersect, the angles across the intersection point from each other are equal 
		(congruent). Any vertical angles should immediately be marked as equal.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.5 Parallel Lines</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Parallel lines are not of any use in and of themselves on the SAT. The only reason parallel lines are useful 
		is because alternate interior angles are congruent. Therefore, whenever you are told that lines are parallel (whether you are told directly, it is indicated in a 
		diagram, or implied by a particular shape such as a trapezoid or parallelogram), you should immediately think of alternate interior angles.</font></p>

			<img src="Lesson_4.PNG" alt="Geometry Diagram 4">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Alternate interior angles are the angles that occur on opposite (<i>alternate</i>) sides of the transversal 
		(the line that cuts through the two parallel lines) but inside (<i>interior</i>) two parallel lines.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Using alternate interior angles and vertical angles, several angles can be related to each other.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Sometimes alternate interior angles are hidden. However, they are still there. To uncover them, 
		the parallel lines and the transversal should be extended.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.6 Similar Triangles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If two triangles are similar, it means two things.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> All the corresponding angles are congruent.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> All the corresponding sides are proportional.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">First we solve for v and x:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">50 + 60 + v = 180<br>v = 70<br>60 + 70 + x = 180<br>x = 50</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This means the triangles are similar because all the angles are the same. Specifically, ΔABC ~ ΔDEF.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Therefore, the sides are proportional and we can solve for y and z.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">8.7 Special Types of Triangles</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Equilateral Triangles</strong></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Equilateral triangles have the following properties:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> All three side lengths are the same.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> All three angle measures are the same (60°).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is useful to know.</font></p>

			<img src="Lesson_7.PNG" alt="Geometry Diagram 7">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where s is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle. If you don't remember the formula for the area 
		of an equilateral triangle, it can be derived easily using the 30-60-90 special triangle (see below).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>Isosceles Triangles</strong></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Isosceles triangles have the following properties:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> Two side lengths are the same.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> Two angle measures are the same.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">It is important to remember that if you know one of these items is true, you know that the other is true as 
		well.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>30-69-90 Triangles</strong></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A 30-60-90 triangle is a right triangle in which the other two angles are 30° and 60°. 30-60-90 triangles 
		are particularly useful because they result from splitting an equilateral triangle in half. The formula for 30-60-90 triangles is given to you on the 
		SAT.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To use the 30-60-90 formula, side lengths should only be compared to the side across from 30°.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To get the hypotenuse, multiply the side across from 30° by 2. To get the side across from 60°, multiply 
		the side across from 30° by √3.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you have the hypotenuse, divide it by 2 to get the side across from 30°. If you have the side across from 
		60°, divide it by √3 to get the side across from 30°.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>45-45-90 Triangles</strong></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A 45-45-90 triangle is a right triangle in which the other two angles are equal. Thus, it is an isosceles 
		triangle. Therefore, the other two angles are each 45°. The formula for 45-45-90 triangles is given to you on the SAT.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Each of the two legs will be equal in length. If you have the length of a leg, simply multiply it by √2 to get 
		the length of the hypotenuse. If you have the length of the hypotenuse, simply divide it by √2 to get the length of the legs.</font></p>

		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">You must know the Pythagorean theorem.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Pythagorean triples are three whole numbers that work together in the Pythagorean theorem. The most common 
		Pythagorean triple is 3 − 4 − 5. The second most common Pythagorean triple is 5 − 12 − 13. Any multiple of a Pythagorean triples also works. Therefore, 
		9 − 12 − 15 is also a Pythagorean triple. Recognizing Pythagorean triples on the test can save a lot of time.</font></p>
