		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">y = mx + b</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">where m is the slope of the line and b is the y intercept of the line, they are easily graphed.</font></p>

		<strong><p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Finding the Linear Function When the Slope and a Point are Given</font></p></strong>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you are given the slope and a point, the equation of the linear function is easily found by plugging 
		the slope in for m and then plugging the x and y values of the point in to solve for b.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Find the equation of the line with slope −2 and passing through (3, −5).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">m = -2<br>y = mx + b<br>y = -2x + b</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Next we plug the point (3, −5) in for x and y to solve for b.</font></p>

		points, we must start by finding the slope.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">3.2 Interpreting Linear Functions</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are several word problems that ask you to interpret the m and b values of a linear function. This is what 
		the slope and y intercept mean in the context of a word problem:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> <strong>slope</strong> (m): the amount the y variable changes for an increase of one in the x value</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> <strong>y intercept</strong> (b): the initial or starting value or quantity of the problem</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">3.3 Graphing Linear Functions</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To graph a linear function, simply put it in the form y = mx + b. First, plot the y-intercept (from the b value). 
		Second, use the slope (m) to plot a second point, using the rise and run determined by the slope. Then connect the two points with a line.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">3.4 Parallel and Perpendicular</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If two lines are parallel, this means they have the same slope. Thus, the following two equations are 
		parallel.</font></p>

		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If two lines are perpendicular, this means that their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other. 
		Thus, the following two equations are perpendicular.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">Warm Up Question Explanation</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">The answer to the warm up question is "C. f(n) = 783 + 8n". The question says that County X 
		had 783 miles of paved road in 2014 and is building 8 miles of new paved roads each year, the expression 783 + 8n gives the number of miles of paved roads 
		in County X in the year that is n years after 2014. To elaborate, when n = 1 (as in, one year after 2014), the county would have built 8 miles of road. 
		Thus, the total length of the road would be 783 + 8 = 791 or, if you're using the equation, 783 + 8(1) = 791. When n = 2, the county would have built 16 miles
		of road as 2 years would have elapsed and the county builds 8 miles of road every year. Thus, the total length of the road would be 783 + 8 + 8 = 799 or, 
		if you're using the equation, 783 + 8(2) = 799. Since C is the only equation that demonstrates compatibility with our addition, it would be the best choice and, 
		indeed, the correct choice.</font></p>
