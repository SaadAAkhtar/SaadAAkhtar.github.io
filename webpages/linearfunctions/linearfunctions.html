		<p><font color = "#FEFEFE">Try your best to answer the question below:</font></p>
		<br>
		<p><font color = "#FEFEFE">In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has 
		been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, if n is the number 
		of years after 2014, which of the following functions f gives the number of miles 
		of paved road there will be in County X? (Assume that no paved roads go out of 
		service.) </font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A. f(n) = 8 + 783n<br>
		B. f(n) = 2,014 + 783n<br>C. f(n) = 783 + 8n<br>D. f(n) = 2,014 + 8n</font></p>
		<br>
		<p><font color = "#FEFEFE">Don't worry if you're stumped. This question is just meant
		to get your brain thinking about the upcoming material. We'll discuss the answer at the end of the upcoming lesson, so keep your answer choice in mind.
