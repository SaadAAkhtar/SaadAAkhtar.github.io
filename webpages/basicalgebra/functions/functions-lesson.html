		<hr>	
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Functions are simply another way of representing equations such as</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">y = x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 12</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">In function notation, this would be</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 12</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">As such, functions themselves are easy to work with. But people get confused by 
		the notation. You just need to keep two things straight in your mind.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> f(3) means plug 3 in for x because the x in f(x) has been replaced by a 3</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> f(x) = 7 means set the whole equation equal to 7 because f(x) is the "name" of the function</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There is one more piece of information you need to keep in mind with functions. You can plug 
		<i>anything</i> into a function. For example, using the function f(x) above, we can plug a heart into it.</font></p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This may look odd, but there is nothing mathematically wrong with it. The key idea is that wherever there 
		was an x, you replace it with a <span> </span><img src="Lesson_2.PNG" alt="Functions Diagram 2"></font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This is important when dealing with composite functions. A composite function is when one function is plugged 
		into another function. This is allowed because you can plug anything into a function. The process is the exact same as plugging the heart in - anywhere there was 
		an x, you replace it. If we are given the functions</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">f(x) = -3x + 5<br>g(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">and are asked to find f(g(x)), this simply means that we plug g(x) into f(x). That is, we replace every x 
		in f(x) with g(x).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">f(g(x)) = -3(g(x)) + 5<br>= -3(x<sup>2</sup> + 1) + 5<br>= -3x<sup>2</sup> - 3 + 5<br>= -3x<sup>2</sup> + 2</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">When graphing functions, if one function is less than the other, this means that its graph is below the 
		other function's graph.</font></p>
