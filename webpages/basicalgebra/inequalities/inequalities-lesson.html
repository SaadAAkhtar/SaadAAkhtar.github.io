		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.12.1 Solving Inequalities</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To solve an inequality, simply treat the inequality sign as an equal sign and solve the equation as you 
		normally would. The only other thing you need to do is turn the inequality around if you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">-2x -7 < 5<br>-2x < 12<br>x > -6</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If you have an equation with two inequalities in it, you can either break it into two inequalities and 
		treat them as you normally would or you can solve for the variable by doing the same thing to all three sides of the equation (again, remember to turn the 
		inequality around if you multiply or divide by a negative).</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.12.2 Graphing Inequalities</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To graph an inequality, the y must be isolated. The line can then be graphed as if it were an ordinary 
		equal sign, keeping the following points in mind.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is less than (<) or greater than (>), the line will be dashed.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is less than or equal to (≤) or greater than or equal to (≥), the line will be solid.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is greater than (>) or greater than or equal to (≥), shade above the line.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is less than (<) or less than or equal to (≤), shade below the line.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">If the equations to be graphed are given to you as an equation with two inequalities in it, simply break 
		the equation into two equations and solve each one for y.</font></p>

		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is less than (<) or less than or equal to (≤), shade inside the circle.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">> If the equation is greater than (>) or less than or equal to (≥), shade outside the circle.</font></p>
