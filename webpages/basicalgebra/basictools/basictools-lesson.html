		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.1.1 Keywords</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are lots of keywords that can help with interpreting word problems. Most of these are pretty intuitive. 
		However, two are worth noting because they occur so frequently and regularly throw students off.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>of</strong> - always means multiply</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE"><strong>per</strong> - always means divide</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.1.2 Solving Basic Algebraic Expressions</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Solving basic algebraic expressions requires working towards getting a variable alone. To do this, inverse 
		operations must be undone in reverse order of operations (PEMDAS).</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">3x<sup>2</sup> + 4 = 79</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Ordinarily, the order of operations would tell us to do the exponent, then the multiplication, and finally 
		the addition. But because we are solving for x, we do these in reverse order.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p class="text-center"><font color = "#FEFEFE">3x<sup>2</sup> = 75<br>x<sup>2</sup> = 25<br>x = ±5</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">A word about fractions. If you are undoing a fraction that is being multiplied by a variable, the inverse 
		operation would be to divide by the fraction. This will work, but it is easier to simply multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">By dividing:</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.1.3 Combining Like Terms</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Combining like terms is a basic mathematical operation. However, it can be visual confusing. It is therefore 
		important to create visual cues for yourself, such as crossing out terms once you have used them.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">To combine line terms, simply identify terms  that have the same combination of variables and exponents and 
		then combine their coefficients.</font></p>

		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.1.4 Fraction Busting</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">There are numerous types of problems that involve fractions that can be made significantly easier by 
		eliminating the fractions. This can be done by multiplying all terms by the common denominator (also known as "fraction busting").</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">For example, if we have the following equation</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_4.PNG" alt="Basic Tools Diagram 4">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">we can eliminate all the fractions by multiplying by a term to cancel with all the denominators. 6 will 
		cancel with the 2 and the 3, and we will need an x as well to cancel with the x in the denominator.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_5.PNG" alt="Basic Tools Diagram 5">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This equation will be significantly easier to solve than the one involving fractions.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">As mentioned, fraction busting can be used in several different contexts. For example, it can be 
		used to make solving systems of equations easier.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_6.PNG" alt="Basic Tools Diagram 6">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This system would be a lot easier to solve if the first question didn't involve fractions. We can 
		make things a lot easier if we multiply it by 3.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_7.PNG" alt="Basic Tools Diagram 7">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">This will make solving the system of equations a lot easier.</font></p>
		<br>
		
		<h5><font color = "#FEFEFE">1.1.5 Cross Multiplying</font></h5>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Cross multiplying is a powerful tool for eliminating fractions whenever you have a single fraction 
		equal to another single fraction (keep in mind that any whole number is a fraction). In fact, cross multiplying should be used whenever you have a 
		single fraction equal to another single fraction.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">Cross multiplying is done by simply multiplying the numerator (top) of one fraction by the denominator 
		(bottom) of the other fraction and setting it equal to the denominator (bottom) of the first fraction times the numerator (top) of the second fraction.</font></p>
		<br>
		<div class="text-center">
			<img src="Lesson_8.PNG" alt="Basic Tools Diagram 8">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 20px"><font color = "#FEFEFE">An important tip to keep in mind is that all numbers are fractions, even if they don't look like one. A number 
		(such as 5) or a variable (such as x) or an expression (such as 5y−3) can be written as a fraction by placing them over one. This can easily turn a fraction 
		problem into a cross multiplying problem, and thus eliminate the fractions.</font></p>
